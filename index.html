            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <img src="https://placehold.it/200x200" alt="Kyle Mulqueen">

            <p>Kyle Mulqueen is an aspiring web developer based in Denver, CO. He is completely new to web development and coding,
                but is excited to see where this new journey will take him. His background is in music performance; he has
                been playing drums for over 15 years. He graduated from Metropolitan State University of Denver in 2017 with
                a BM in Jazz Performance with an emphasis in drum-set. During his time at MSU Denver, Kyle developed a skill
                set that transcends music and helps him in his everyday life. You may ask yourself, "What skills could one
                possibly learn from jazz school that would help them in normal situations?" Simple. Improvisation, communication,
                and teamwork. Kyle's ability to improvise and adapt to new and unfamiliar situations will help him (hopefully)
                become a professional web developer... and have a cooler part-time gig than most people.</p>
